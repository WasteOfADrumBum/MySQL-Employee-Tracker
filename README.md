## Installation

> 1.npm init // 2.npm install mysql inquirer // 3.npm install console.table --save

- Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

- Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

- Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

## Instructions

> Open your terminal and go inside the repo where the tracker.js is located. In your terminal type node tracker.js (nodemon tracker.js won't work properly with inquirer list choices). Follow the prompts to interact with the information of your company as desired.
